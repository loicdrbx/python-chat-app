# The Chat App

## Description
The Chat App is a client-server chat application built from scratch in Python. It allows multiple clients to connect to a central server and exchange messages in real-time. The Chat App is multithreaded and uses TCP sockets for communication.

## Installation 
1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP file and extract it.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

## Running the server
 
1. Run ```Python3 server.py``` in a terminal or command prompt.

## Running the client

1. Run ```Python3 client.py``` in a terminal or command prompt.

## Troubleshooting
- **Graceful Termination on Keyboard Interrupts:** Neither the server or client terminate gracefully when stopped with keyboard interrupts (Ctrl+C). Please terminate using the by typing {quit} into the terminal instead.

Enjoy chatting with The Chat App!
